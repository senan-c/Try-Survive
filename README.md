# Try Survive
This is Try Survive, a text-based zombie survival game where you decide what happens. Experience the zombie apocalypse day by day as you struggle to find enough food, water and supplies while playing through the 23 events and 5 mission available. No two playthroughs will be the same as each event has several different endings to discover. But beware, some choices may have dire consequences!

Tips for Surviving:
1. Make sure to eat enough food - It greatly affects your success in combat
2. Watch out for injuries - These will stop you from scavenging while you heal
3. Be wary of humans - Think twice before messing with survivors and fighting raiders
4. Grab a weapon - Fighting zombies with your bare hands is just a bad idea
5. Think twice - Do you really need to loot that store when there's food at home?
6. Find some armour - This can save your life when fighting both zombies and humans
7. Don't be greedy - Don't loot with a horde outside unless you want to join them
